            <p>We are increasingly relying on the Internet in the past few years. The epidemic is still raging, which greatly changed how people live. Working from home, shopping online as well as e-consumption has been more common nowadays. 
            People's online behaviour has changed gradually.  However, many of them do not have sufficient understanding on network security. This gives opportunities for hackers to invade their assets or steal their personal information.
            The number of cases of technology-based crimes more than doubled in the first half of the year, to some 6,400 in Hong Kong.</p>

                <li><p>In the first quarter of this year, HKCERT has processed over 300 phishing attack incidents per month on average, up about 30% from the same period last year. Apart from the increase in cases, HKCERT has also noticed that hackers have been using new techniques, with some using fake domain names to steal the victim’s personal information and use it in financial fraud. This blog aims to raise public awareness by analysing the recent phishing attack techniques and channels as observed by HKCERT.</p>

                <li>
                <p>In recent years, ransomware attacks have evolved and become more frequent worldwide, including Hong Kong, wreaking extensive havoc. Hackers have continued to develop new techniques or even changed their operation model in a bid to maximise the amount and chance of ransom payments. Human-operated ransomware, ransomware as a service (RaaS) and multiple extortion are some of these examples. The average ransomware payment stood at US$570,000 in the first half of 2021, up 82% from last year’s average payment of US$312,000 [1]. It is one of the biggest cyber threats faced by companies and organisations nowadays.</p>
                </li>
                <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in the first half of 2021, 111 bank customers were affected by phishing attacks, involving an aggregate amount of HK$22 million.
                    No such cases were reported in 2020, according to the Authority.
                    The HKMA also pointed out that phishing frauds have increased significantly recently.
                    Based on official statistics, banks detected 169 cases of suspicious websites, mobile applications, and phishing SMS and emails in the first six months of 2021, up 145 percent from 69 in the first half of 2020.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><h3>Distribution Methods</h3>
                    <p>Hackers may use different channels to launch phishing attacks, such as email, SMS and instant messaging software. Phishing attacks via SMS and instant messaging software will become more frequent with the wider use of mobile devices.  As a result, the public should verify any message received, especially when the user browses these sites using mobile devices. To avoid becoming a victim, think carefully before clicking any links or opening any attachments, and do verify the legitimacy of a website before providing any information.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Flash phishing attacks</h3>
                    <p>Flash phishing attacks make use of fake domain names to launch attacks. Hackers continuously register different domain names targeted to specific organisations. They then launch a fake website using the registered domain and send the phishing message with a link to the victims through different channels (e.g. email, SMS, Instant Message). The attack will last for a few days. Afterwards, hackers will deregister those fake domain names and then launch a new round of attacks with another set of domain names. The characteristic of this technique is that the fake websites have a very short lifespan. Therefore, when the websites are reported, they are already offline. We believe that the attacker's tactic is to evade investigation and blacklisting.

                </li>
                <li><h3>Phishing sites use HTTPS</h3>
                    <p>Websites using HTTPS only mean the network traffic has been encrypted. It does not necessarily mean the websites are genuine and credible. Attackers can abuse free digital certificate registration sites such as Let’s Encrypt to register a digital certificate for an untrusted domain. Indeed, HTTPS-enabled phishing sites have continued to climb.  According to the Hong Kong Security Watch Report for Q1 2021, over 80% of phishing sites were using HTTPS.  This rising trend is also in line with the latest report of Anti-Phishing Working Group.

            <ul>
            <li><p>To avoid phishing attacks, you can use some desktop browsers which come with anti-phishing features or support an anti-phishing plug-in. However, most of the browsers on mobile devices do not have anti-phishing features. If users neglect this, it increases the chance to fall into phishing traps.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Because of the screen resolution and size of mobile devices, the URL address bar will be hidden when the page has finished loading, and only the subdomain of the website will be displayed. Therefore, users should always check the URL before clicking on it.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Furthermore, we should pay attention when login to or fill in a web form on websites. If a "lock icon" is displayed on the web browser, it means the site is a trusted and secure website. If there is no lock icon, or a lock with a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross, users should beware of the website
